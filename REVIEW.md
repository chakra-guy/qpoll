# Questions

- Can I update poll options from both endpoints? -> `/polls/:id/` and `/polls/:id/poll-options/:option-id/`
- What's best practise for `poll_options` in Views
  -- :preload in list view or have 2 different views?
- CRUD resource from 2 endpoints? (dedicated and nested)
- Is it best practise to use binary_id over id for ecto types?
- PollController: best practise for key name changes options -> poll_options?
